## BIOS Settings

- Followed all steps here: <https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html#intel-bios-settings>
- Couldn't find the option to disable "CFG Lock", but both `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` and `AppleXcpmCfgLock` are added to Kernel -> Quirks as detailed in the docs.
